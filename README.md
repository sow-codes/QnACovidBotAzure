# About Project

This project is about the website which is made for the purpose of Covid update to users. 

Problem statement:
From the year 2019, people all around the world facing difficulties with Covid19 virus. But People were unable to get updates about Covid19 to keep themselves safe from crisis. For this issue, I have developed a website with bot services which can clarify all the queries about Covid19.

Project Description:
The core idea of this project is to clarify the queries about Covid19. People can get their queries clarified within minutes using this website. This website is integrated with bot service. This bot is developed with QnAmaker which is one of the services of Microsoft Azure. Users can easily interact with bot via chat. Using this bot, user can get instant information about Covid19 and Vaccine.


Azure Services I used in this project:
1.QnAMaker
2.Web App Bot
3.Static Web Apps

For creating Question and Answer pair, I have used QnAMaker. I integreted QnAMAker with Web App bot. Then for hosting I have used Static Web App Service.
Azure Static Web Apps is a service that automatically builds and deploys full stack web apps to Azure from a code repository.

Following are some key features of Azure Static Web Apps that made me choose this service:

Web hosting for static content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.
Integrated API support provided by Azure Functions with the option to link an existing Azure Functions app using a standard account.
First-class GitHub and Azure DevOps integration where repository changes trigger builds and deployments.
Globally distributed static content, putting content closer to your users.
Free SSL certificates, which are automatically renewed.
Custom domains to provide branded customizations to your app.
Seamless security model with a reverse-proxy when calling APIs, which requires no CORS configuration.
Authentication provider integrations with Azure Active Directory, GitHub, and Twitter.
Customizable authorization role definition and assignments.
Back-end routing rules enabling full control over the content and routes you serve.
